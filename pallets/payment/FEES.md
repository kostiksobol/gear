Some rationale behind the implementation.


## Economic measures to control the message queue size

### Fees in Substrate

Managing the `MessageQueue` size using ecomonic means in *Gear* requires some general understanding of how transaction fees are viewed in Substrate.
In a Substrate-based blockchain, validators process transactions in exchange for a reward. This reward comes from the accumulated transaction fees. The logic is roughly the following:
- a block is worth a certain amount of currency; at the same time a block time is a network invariant expressed in so-called ‚Äúweight‚Äù. There is a `weight-to-fee` conversion function that maps time units (`Weight`) onto currecny units (`Balance`).

To secure a share in a block for their transaction, a user pays a fee. The fee in Substrate consists of several parts:
- `base_fee` represents the necessary work validator should do to pull a transaction from the tx pool (regardless of anything),
- `length_fee` which is proportional to the size of an encoded transaction, and
- `weight_fee` which is a function of the transaction weight as meausre of computational load (as discussed earlier).

```
                                            block time
     _______________________________________________________________________________________
    |                     | + + + + + + + + |                                               |
    |                     | +  tx weight  + |                                               |
    |_____________________|_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_|_______________________________________________|
                          \________ ________/
                                   V
                           tx processing time
```

`Fee = base_fee + P‚ãÖtx.len + F(tx.weight)`, where `P` - per byte cost, `F(.)` - weight to fee conversion function.
<br/>

Fees in Substrate are charged upfront; in fact, if a user doesn‚Äôt have enough balance to pay fees, a transaction will be invalidated and dropped even before it gets to be dispathced. Any ‚Äúleftover‚Äù from pre-charged fee is returned to the user upon the transaction processing completion. This is achieved through keeping track of the already paid fees and weight that was actually spent.

<br/>

### Accounting for peaks in the network

If the number of users who want to submit transactions exceeds a block capacity, users have to compete in order to secure a slot in a block. Naturally, transactions become more expensive in terms of the currency. This makes a whole block cost more comparing to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù times.
Substrate defines a certain measure of the network congestion (by inspecting the state of the transaction pool), and linearly scales the extrinsics fees with respect to this measure by multiplying the `weight_fee` part by a factor being a function of the network congestion level:

`Fee = base_fee + P‚ãÖtx.len + ùõÇ‚ãÖF(tx.weight)`, where `ùõÇ` - dynamically adjusted multiplier.
<br/>

**Note**: changing the `weight-to-fee` conversion function itself might seem another way to reflect higher cost of a Weight unit. However, the `weight-to-fee` function does not have to be linear with respect to weight (even though it normally is), therefore calibrating it in such a way that the resulting fee is proportional to the network congestion can be hard.

<br/>

### Adding WASM execution to the picture

Substrate has its own `contracts` pallet in Frame. In `contracts` pallet, adding WASM code execution to extrinsic processing does not change the general way of how fees are charged.

An additional concept of `gas` is introduced in order to
- limit the amount of computations to prevent DoS attacks;
- have an idea of a contract computational complexity to be able to apply fees.

In the `contracts` pallet gas is measured in the same units as weight. Furthermore, in context of computing fees, the transaction `gas_limit` is simply added to the extrinsic weight. This is possible due to the fact WASM execution is syncronous in `contracts` pallet: the entire transaction is processed in one go (even if there is a chain of nested calls to other contracts) so upon completion the tx executor knows exactly how much gas has been spent and whether there has been changes to extrinsic weight. That is, calculating the leftover that needs to be refunded is easy.

```
                                            block time

    |                     | +  tx weight  +  x x       gas_limit     x x |                  |
    |_____________________|_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+__x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_|__________________|
                          \_______________________ ______________________/
                                                  V
                                           tx processing time
```

`Fee = base_fee + P‚ãÖtx.len +  ùõÇ‚ãÖF(tx.weight + tx.gas_limit)`
<br/><br/>

### *Gear* up WASM execution

In *Gear*, however, a transaction life cycle is more complex: *Gear* is built on top of the *Actor model* with asyncronous messages between the actors. When a transaction is pulled from the tx pool (as in a standard Substrate scenario), it may (or may not) result into a `message` being created and fed into the `MessageQueue`. Furthermore, other outgoing messages can be enqueued as a result of a message processing. The overall time spent on a message is limited by the `gas_limit`, which must be accounted for when calculating fees a user pays for a transaction.

The entire block time is split into two uneven parts: incoming extrinsics processing and messages execution. Each transaction can contribute to both:

```
                                          block time
     _________________________________________/\___________________________________________
    /                                                                                      \
          extrinsics procesing                           messages execution
     _____________________________    ______________________________________________________

    |    | + weight |             |  |              | x x   gas_limit   x x |               |
    |____|_+_+_+_+_+|_____________|  |______________|_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_|_______________|
               \____________                      __________/
                            \                    /
                           two-fold tx contribution
```

<br/>

### Key features that make *Gear* stand out:

- in *Gear* we actually have two distinct queues: the tx pool and the `MessageQueue`. They act as a system of communicating vessels, however, the level of fullness of each pool changes independently. This, in particular, means that, generally, gauging the level of network congestion solely based on the transaction pool size and not taking into account how full or empty the `MessageQueue` is, can be inaccurate;

- messages processing in *Gear* is async, which means a message created by an extrinsic is processed at later time (can easily be even a different block) with respect to the extrinsic itself. As a connsequence, by the time we post-process a dispatched call and calculate the amount to rebate to the user the exact amount of gas that will have been consumed by WASM execution is still unknown;

- in *Gear*, unlike the `contracts` pallet, `Gas` is not an ephemeral entity but it can actually store value and must be expilictly exchanged with currency units. On the other hand, as a computational complexity measure, `Gas` unit always equals `Weight` unit. This means we have to consider a "triangle" diagram of different value representations, which should always commute in order not to let malicious players take advantage of the system:

```
                                Weight
                                /    \
                               /      \
                              /        \
                             /          \
                           Gas ------ Balance
```

In particular, the async nature of the actor model expalins why we shouldn't manipulate the `gas_price()` function: when a message goes for processing, gas is converted to currency and reserved in `Balances` pallet. Upon completion, the unused gas is released back to the user. If the gas price has changed in the meantime, the released amount may differ from what was due, representing another attack vector based on gas price manipulation.

<br/>

### Proposed solution

First, we define a set of invariants our system should comply with in context of fees calculation:
- Fees are calculated upfront and transparent to the user; should be visible in the UI, no hidden payments are supposed to take place;
- Users only pay for what they actually use. Any fees collected in excess must be refunded;
- Fees should fluctuate reflecting the level of network congestion. At peak periods fees should be higher to create a barrier for incoming transactions and relieve pressure on the processing engine.


The most reasonable idea seems to follow the `contracts` pallet, with a couple of nuances:

- we do not directly add weight and `gas_limit` because they are measured in different units;
- we use two fee multipliers: one for the tx pool, the other for the `MessageQueue`.

The formula will roughly look like so:

`Fee = base_fee + P‚ãÖtx.len +  ùõÇ‚ãÖF(tx.weight) + ùõÉ‚ãÖG(tx.gas_limit), s.t. ùõÇ ‚â• 1, ùõÉ ‚â• 1`,

where `P` - per byte cost, `F(.)` - weight to fee conversion function, `G(.)` - gas-to-fee conversion function (`gas_price`), `ùõÉ` - fee multiplier reflecting the message queue congestion level.

**Note**: in current implementation gas is bought and released upon message processing inside the `pallet-gear`, hence it shouldn't be charged in `pallet-transaction-payment`; only the additional term responsible for the message queue size must be dealt with here.

Therefore the fees we'd need to collect in `transaction-payment` pallet will shrink to

`Fee = base_fee + P‚ãÖtx.len +  ùõÇ‚ãÖF(tx.weight) + (ùõÉ - 1)‚ãÖG(tx.gas_limit), ùõÇ ‚â• 1, ùõÉ ‚â• 1`.

In the UI though, the full fee including the amount to be reserved later should be displayed.

**Pros**:
- the resulting fee is a function of the `gas_limit`, that is encompasses all potential nested calls (outgoing messages).

**Cons**:
- after an extrinsic has been dispatched, we must return the unused fee. If the consumed weight is known, the total actual spent gas is not yet known.

<br/>

Hence a need for an approximation.

In current implementation we suggest the following:

`Fee = base_fee + P‚ãÖtx.len +  ùù≤‚ãÖùõÇ‚ãÖF(tx.weight), ùõÇ ‚â• 1, ùù≤ ‚â• 1`, where `ùù≤` is some empirical factor reflecting the fullness of the message queue (generally, different from `ùõÉ` in the equation above). The `G(tx.gas_limit)` term is still implcitly present (and should be displayed in the UI) but it is not charged until a message is created for an extrinsic and pushed into the message queue.
